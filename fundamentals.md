**What is web 3.0 for Oranj?**

We build bridges between the physical and digital world.

> How?

Digital assets and asset tokenization powered by smart contracts.

NFTs = Non-Fungible Tokens, are only a way to tokenize physical assets, digitally, on chain.

We will not use the term NFTs henceforth, we will only refer to the ‘product’ we are building as digital assets and the ‘service’ we provide will be blockchain based solutions.

**Oranj – Bridging physical to the digital**

Oranj bridges physical things to the digital world, thereby creating digital assets.
These assets can be traded, managed in digital form.
> WE CONVERT PHYSICAL THINGS TO THEIR DIGITAL COUNTERPART, THUS CREATING DIGITAL ASSETS.

Disclaimer: web 3.0 is more than just digital assets, but that is not where our focus lies, we focus on digital assets and the conversion of physical to digital assets alone. Powered by blockchain and smart contracts.

**Smart Contracts – The powerhouse of Oranj**

Smart contracts self-execute code with pre-decided rules/agreements to eliminate all intermediaries, i.e., no middle-men whatsoever, and a lot of time, money and effort saved.

> Smart contracts ensure code is law. 

We will be using ICP to empower our systems – smart contracts on ICP are called canisters. 

With a base layer as bitcoin, which provides unmatched security and transparency, ICP is a sidechain that provides the programmable layer on top.
